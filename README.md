* Created a program that can detect if pneumonia is present in an uploaded image
* Used random oversampling of minority class to handle data imbalance
* Performed data augmentation
* Utilized transfer learning on 5 networks (using weights from Imagenet)
* Created ensemble network to handle classification task based on trained networks
* Packaged into a portable executable file
